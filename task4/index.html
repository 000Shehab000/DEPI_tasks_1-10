            Toshinori Yagi (八や木ぎ俊とし典のり Yagi Toshinori?), also known as
            All Might (オールマイト Ōru Maito?), is the former No. 1 Pro Hero
            who bore the title of the world's Symbol of Peace (平和の象徴 Heiwa
            no Shōchō?). He teaches Foundational Hero Studies at U.A. High
            School. All Might was the eighth holder of the One For All Quirk
            after receiving it from Nana Shimura. He has since passed the torch
            onto Izuku Midoriya, whom he is training to be his successor. After
            using up all the embers of One For All to defeat All For One, All
            Might retired and ended his era as the world's greatest hero.[3]
